  <p>The services are owned and operated by <em>Overhide LLC</em>, Wyoming, USA (collectively, "Overhide LLC", "we", "us", "our").</p>

  <p>The services may provide features redirecting your interaction from the services to third parties. The transition
    away from the services to these third parties is explicit by your user action (clicking). You will be aware when
    you're interacting with third parties through their branding. Your "Terms of Service" with these third parties are
    separate from this agreement. When interacting with these third parties abide by their terms as made available by
    them.</p>

  <p>This agreement sets out the legally binding terms for your use of the services and may be modified by us from time to
    time at our sole discretion. Any modifications shall be effective upon posting by us on the Website.</p>

    this agreement and (b) will abide by all of the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you have agreed to become a

    the following provisions of this agreement will remain in effect: Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14,

  <h2 id="4availabilityofandaccesstoservices">3. Availability of and Access to Services.</h2>

    outage clearly and explicitly to the user. These outages could be due to third parties that the Service depends on.
    Also while we will make commercially reasonable attempts to backup all data stored by the services, in the event of
    recovery from disaster, the user may have to reconfigure the Service to get it back to the state it was in before the
    outage. The services are hosted by a third party hosting service provider. We and our third party service providers

    integrity of data; (c) protect against unauthorized access to or use of data; (d) encrypt data during transmission by
    the services and its third party service providers and when being uploaded by user for use in connection with the
    services using an https connection; and (e) ensure that the services' return or disposal of data is performed in a
    manner consistent with the foregoing. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able
    to defeat those measures to access your data for improper purposes. You acknowledge that there are risks inherent in
    Internet connectivity that could result in the loss of your privacy, confidential information and property.</p>

    be intercepted and manipulated by said third parties. The services are not involved and cannot be held responsible for
    data before it reaches the services. </p>
